# Text Fixer

This Python script `text_fixer.py` takes an input string where some words are in reverse order, and some words in the correct order are wrapped in parentheses. It reverses the non-parenthesized words and removes the parentheses from the correct words to fix the text.

## Example

For example, given the input:
nhoJ (Griffith) nodnoL saw (an) (American) ,tsilevon ,tsilanruoj (and) laicos .tsivitca ((A) reenoip (of) laicremmoc noitcif (and) naciremA ,senizagam (he) saw eno (of) (the) tsrif (American) srohtua (to) emoceb (an) lanoitanretni ytirbelec (and) nrae a egral enutrof (from) ).gnitirw

The script will output:
John Griffith London was an American novelist, journalist, and social activist. (A pioneer of commercial fiction and American magazines, he was one of the first American authors to become an international celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing.)
